# winFixSearchProblem
windows 11 have a search issue which by running this executable program problem will solve.
I had a problem with Windows search and I tried many solutions Some of them included the use of Windows PowerShell But now it won't be a problem just by executing one command.
it hit me to implement the problem under a comprehensive plan, following repo included a cpp file and by compile it, end users can terminate any task only by giving name to the program after that all parent and child task that related will terminate.

## Usage
+ Clone project into your computer.
+ Go to the directory where you cloned repo.
+ Compile cpp file using following command.
> g++ -o main.exe src\assassin.cpp
+ run this command to kill SearchHost.exe for fixing problem.
> main.exe SearchHost

fill free to use and enjoy ;) don't forget give ‚≠ê
